                In order to complete a Booking the following steps are taken to ensure its validity: When we place Service Elements on our Site, we are inviting you to make an offer for their purchase. You do not make this offer until you press “Book” on the payment page of the Site. Once you have done so you have made flyticket.com.bd  an offer (which cannot be withdrawn if you change your mind) to purchase the relevant Service Element(s) from the relevant Travel Supplier(s) (your “Booking”). We are free to accept your offer on behalf of the relevant Travel Supplier or to reject it, at our sole discretion. The flyticket.com.bd  email confirmation is NOT the contractual acceptance of the Booking, but merely an acknowledgment that we have received your offer. We will need to check the availability of the relevant Service Element(s). If the relevant Service Element is available, your Booking will be processed. The contract pertaining to the relevant Booking is formed when payment in full has been received. The contract between you and the relevant Travel Supplier will relate only to those Service Elements confirmed by email with ticket numbers in case of air or reservation numbers in case of hotels, cars or activities. The terms of your Booking (such as price, availability and/or dates of travel) are not guaranteed until the contract is formed between you and the Travel Supplier and a ticket has been issued and/or a reservation has been made and confirmed by the Travel Supplier. Please note that once you have completed the Booking stage you can only cancel or change the details (such as names or destinations) of your Booking at our sole discretion and in accordance with these Terms & Conditions. These Booking processes will apply to any of our individual Service Element’s Terms & Conditions set out below. The airline ticket Terms & Conditions, the hotel Terms & Conditions, the car rental Terms & Conditions, the attractions and services Terms & Conditions supplement any area not covered by the Booking process. We reserve the right to change the Booking process at any time, with changes automatically taking effect from the date such changes are posted on the Site. At all times throughout your trip a government-issued photo ID is required for security checks at airports, hotels and car rental locations and may be required for attractions and other products as deemed necessary by the relevant Travel Suppliers. In addition to the required government-issued ID as stated above, proof of citizenship (Passport) is required for international travel. Please note that it is your sole responsibility to ensure that you meet the passport, visa, and/or health requirements of the countries you wish to visit and those that you transit (even if it is for a simple flight change). Many countries require that your passport should be valid for a minimum period from the date of arrival into that country. For any questions regarding what the applicable minimum period is and any other conditions or passport/visa requirements for travel, you should contact the corresponding local consulate of the countries to which you are traveling. Neither flyticket.com.bd  nor its affiliates accept any responsibility, and you will not be entitled to any refunds whatsoever, if you are denied boarding, delayed or deported due to non-fulfillment of the above. Government entry/exit fees may apply, depending on your destination. These are your sole responsibility and will be additional to your Booking charges. All travelers on your Booking (if more than one passenger) must travel on the same itinerary. Individual passengers cannot be added to, and/or deleted from your Booking. flyticket.com.bd  reserves the right to correct errors in any advertised price and, if applicable, give you an option to either cancel the Booking or allow flyticket.com.bd  to collect an amount equal to any increase in price from your provided credit or debit card, your prepaid balance or bKash, prior to your departure. Failure to pay extra charges may result in cancellation of Booking. Each Service Element listed in your Booking is provided by the respective Travel Supplier. Extra charge may be added by Travel supplier for Baggage, Meal and seat selection. Frequent traveler points and/or miles may or may not be available for any portion of your Booking. Temporary Booking will be automatically cancelled after 1 hour. Other type of booking will be automatically cancelled 30 minutes before booking expiration or After maximum 24 hours of booking creation. You must check this with the relevant Travel Supplier. Once you have made your Booking, you cannot transfer or change the name(s) or destination(s) listed in your Booking. The terms of this agreement incorporate by reference the terms of each airline’s contract of carriage. Passengers may inspect the full text of the contract of carriage at each airline’s airport or city ticket offices. Passengers have the right, upon request to the airlines, to receive free of charge by mail or other delivery service the full text of the contract of carriage.

                The incorporated terms of the contract of carriage may include:

                Limits on the airline’s liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage, or delay of goods and baggage, including fragile or perishable goods;

                Claim restrictions, including time periods within which passengers must file a claim or bring an action against the airline for its acts or omissions or those of its agents;

                Rights of the airline to change terms of the contract;

                Rules about reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to carry;

                Rights of the airline and limitations concerning delay or failure to perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of alternate airline or aircraft and rerouting.

                Our total prices include all taxes and fees applicable to airfare, hotel accommodation, car rentals and activities included in your Booking, unless stated otherwise in your ticket information email or in these Terms & Conditions. Additional fuel surcharges, security, baggage, meal, seat reservation, hotel incidentals, and other applicable service charges may apply which will be charged by the relevant Travel Supplier at time of check-in. You are solely responsible for any such additional charges due to the Travel Supplier. If you have any questions about such charges, please contact the relevant Travel Supplier directly. Prices quoted also do not include any additional flight fuel surcharges or other surcharges, which may be imposed from time to time by the relevant Travel Supplier or authorities, all of which must be paid by you. Payment must be made in full with a valid credit or debit card at the time of Booking. flyticket.com.bd  accepts all major credit or debit cards with a verifiable billing address. You hereby authorize flyticket.com.bd  and its authorized third party to process the charge to the credit or debit card you provide to us for the total amount of your Booking. You may be required by the relevant Travel Supplier(s) to present a valid credit or debit card at the time of check-in at the hotel and/or at the pick-up location of the car rental company to provide confirmation of authorized card usage and/or to secure any additional charges. The cardholder must be a traveler listed on your Booking. All offers, prices, and conditions of sale may be subject to:

                change without notice;

                advance purchase, eligibility, seating, or other limitations;

                travel days, dates, minimum or maximum stays, holidays, seasons, blackout dates, stopovers, and/or wait listing restrictions;

                reservation validation limitations of up to one year (if any extension permitted, penalties/restrictions may apply);

                other conditions/restrictions; and

                Availability.

                A reservation is not complete until confirmed/ticketed/issued. To protect our customers, we verify with the credit/debit card company/mobile financial service provider that the billing address and credit/debit card verification number or any mobile financial services transaction number you provided to us is accurate and that your debit/charge will be accepted. Until such information is verified, the fare is subject to change. We are not responsible for any transaction that is declined based upon a credit/debit card or any mobile financial service transaction that is declined by the issuing company or a travel provider or if, for any reason, the debit/credit card or any mobile banking transaction billing address and/or credit card verification number or any other mobile banking transaction number cannot be verified in a timely manner, nor are we responsible for any changes in fare or non-ticketed or any other charges that may occur during our verification process. In the event the fare selected is not available or Ticket not issued, and if the transaction is completed.

                In this case, the paid amount will be added to the current balance by verifying all the particulars sent by the respective client and the client can use the balance in the future or request for refund of the unused balance. The procedures of the request for refunding the unused balance are 
                But if the ticket is issued at a higher price, flyticket.com.bd  reserves the right to correct errors in any advertised price and, if applicable, give you an option to either cancel the Booking or allow flyticket.com.bd  to collect an amount equal to any increase in price from your provided credit or debit card or other mobile banking methods or any other mobile financial service provider, prior to your departure. Failure to pay extra charges may result in the cancellation of the Booking.

                Any and all changes made to the itinerary are restricted and are subject to airline fare rules, whichever is more restrictive; most of our tickets, hotels, cars, packages and cruises do not allow any date or name changes after the booking is completed. flyticket.com.bd  does not guarantee, and shall not be responsible for, any bookings or reservations made or confirmed to you in the event that the original itinerary has been changed by the supplier pursuant to customer’s request or supplier’s schedule changes.

                Most of our airline tickets are 100% non-refundable. In certain cases, where the airline may allow cancellations, a credit may be valid towards a future ticket purchase by the same traveler on the same airline. Usually the credit issued by the airline supplier has a specific expiration date, after which it cannot be used. We encourage you to discuss additional restrictions attached to your credit with a customer service agent. All such bookings where the cancellation may be permitted must be cancelled prior to the scheduled departure time of the first flight segment by calling our customer service center. We do not guarantee any cancellation. When you are ready to make your new booking and wish to use your airline credit, you will be required to the pay fare difference (if any), applicable airline penalties and any applicable flyticket.com.bd  post-ticketing fees. All such changes are governed by each airline’s fare rules, policies and procedures, which are not under our control. No additional representation is made for our exchange fees except that an agent will assist you in locating your desired new flights and attempt to re-book the new flights based on availability and other factors.

                If your itinerary includes flights operated by more than one airline, please read carefully each such airline’s terms and conditions, which can be found on each such airline’s website. Each such airline will have its own restrictions, rules and fees. If one of these flights is affected by an airline change (e.g. cancellation or rescheduling) that causes a Customer to make changes to the other flight, the Customer may be responsible for any fees or ticket cost incurred for making changes to the unaffected flight. Such airlines may charge their own fees for changes, refunds, or if exchanges are requested. You are responsible for complying with each airline’s terms and conditions, which may differ (for example, check-in times and limits on baggage size/weight). It is advisable you print your outbound and return portions of your e-ticket confirmation for all flights prior to traveling. You may be asked for proof of your return ticket at check-in.

                We are unable to provide a specific time line for how long it may take for this requested refund to be processed. All refund requests are processed in a sequential format. Once you have provided our customer service agent with your cancellation request, we will then send you an email notification that your request has been received. This notification does not automatically qualify you for a refund. This only provides you with an acknowledgment of your request and provides you with a tracking number. Upon receipt of your request we will work with the suppliers such as airlines, hotels, car-rental companies to generate a waiver based on airline and other supplier rules and notify you of the supplier decision. Our services fees associated with the original travel reservation or booking are not refundable. Please note that we are dependent on the suppliers for receiving the requested refunds. Once the refund has been approved by the supplier it may take additional time for this to appear on your credit card statement. Generally, all suppliers will charge a penalty for refund. This entire process may take 60-90 days from receipt of your request to receiving credit on your statement. Apart from the airlines and other suppliers refund penalties, flyticket.com.bd  will charge a post-ticketing services fee, as applicable. All refund fees are charged on per ticket per person basis. These fees will only be assessed if a refund has been authorized by the supplier or a waiver has been received and when the airline/supplier rules permit such refunds. If such refund is not processed by the supplier, we will refund you our post-ticketing service fees applicable to your agent assisted refund request, but not our booking fees for the original travel reservation or booking.

                We accept credit cards and debit cards issued in Bangladesh and several other countries as listed in the billings section. We also accept Cash in Office, bKash, Online Bank Transfer, etc. methods as well.

                Please note: all hotel, car rental and tour/activity bookings are only confirmed upon delivery of complete confirmation details to the email you provided with your reservation. In some cases, pre-payment may be required to receive confirmation. In order to provide you with further protection, when certain transactions are determined to be high-risk by our systems, we will not process such transactions unless our credit card verification gateway team has determined that it’s safe to process them. In order to establish validity of such transactions, we may contact you or your bank.

                Most tickets are electronic (e-Tickets). If an e-Ticket is generated the ticket information will be available on the Site. All bookings and fares are not guaranteed until ticketed by the supplier. For Air ticket, hotels, car rentals, and vacation packages, bookings are not guaranteed unless you receive a confirmation number by email.

                flyticket.com.bd  bears no responsibility in the event your credit or debit card is not approved or charged. There can be many reasons why your credit or debit card may not have been approved or charged. Examples of these maybe: airline could not confirm the booking, fare increased since payment information was submitted and prior to ticketing; or sufficient funds not available on the credit card. In such instances where the fare may have increased, you will be provided with alternate options and you have the right to cancel the booking at no cost to you. When the booking is ticketed at the cost originally quoted to you the ticket becomes non-refundable and non-cancellable. flyticket.com.bd  uses stringent safety measures for credit card payment processing. Fraudulent transactions, if any, are reported to airport security, airlines and other law enforcement. You agree to be liable for any and all credit card payments and you agree not to dispute charges after the purchase has been made and your tickets and/or other products have been delivered by email confirmation or have been shipped to you.

                Online credit card transactions are authorized at the time a user or anyone acting on their behalf accepts these Terms & Conditions and continues with the purchase. When certain transactions are determined to be high risk by our systems, we will not process such transactions unless our credit card verification team has determined that it’s safe to process them. In order to establish validity of such transactions, we may contact you or your bank.

                Please note that your seats, meals, frequent flyer and other special requests are requests only. The airline reserves the right to apply any revisions to the requested seat allocation without notification. All requests should be verified with the airline. We do not guarantee you will be assigned the seat you have requested. We also do not guarantee that your meal, frequent flyer and other special requests will be confirmed by the airline. It is therefore recommended you contact your airline directly to confirm these requests.

                If you have excess baggage, you will have to pay any excess baggage fee assessed by each airline. We recommend traveling light to reduce these costs. To find the additional weight baggage fees for each airline, please visit our Booked Airline page. These fees are to be paid directly to airline upon using such service. We make an effort to keep the baggage fees table updated but we recommend you contact the airline directly for the latest fees on check baggage and policy as it relates to baggage.

                When there are two or more airlines involved for connecting flights, you may have to reclaim your bags at the connecting airport and check-in again to continue your journey. In these cases, if you have excess baggage, you will have to pay any excess baggage fee assessed by each airline. We recommend traveling light to reduce these costs.

                All Airlines have differing rules and policies regarding schedule changes, which are beyond our control. Due to the operational needs of each airline, changes are often made to the flights that they are currently operating. Often these changes are a prediction of travel needs for a future dates but can also reflect same day changes. Types of changes could be: flight number changes, time changes, routing, date changes and or cancellations. Cancellations include when an airline has stopped or temporarily canceled service to certain cities, or stopped service on certain days of the week.

                flyticket.com.bd  does not assume any liability whatsoever for cancelled flights, flights that are missed, or flights not connecting due to any scheduled changes made by the airlines.

                We make every attempt to notify the customer of any schedule changes. It is always best to contact the airline to reconfirm you flights within 72 hours of departure.

                It is always important for the customer to reconfirm their flights with the airlines 24 to 72 hours prior to departure, especially if they are already traveling. You should periodically check emails for updates regarding flight schedules and respond in a timely manner.
